# How to contribute
### Adding a new blog post

Blog posts are written in Markdown, images are kept in [/data](https://github.com/notshi/bards/tree/master/plated/source/data).  
If in doubt, check a previous blog post for guidance.

1. Create a new folder in [/blog](https://github.com/notshi/bards/tree/master/plated/source/blog) following the current naming convention _(yy-mm-dd-log-number)_
2. Create a ```^.html``` file as your blog post.
